                Sefirot (/sfɪˈroʊt, ˈsfɪroʊt/; Hebrew: סְפִירוֹת səp̄īrōṯ), meaning emanations, are the 10
                attributes/emanations in Kabbalah, through which Ein Sof (The Infinite) reveals itself and
                continuously
                creates both the physical realm and the chain of higher metaphysical realms (Seder
                hishtalshelus). The
                term is alternatively transliterated into English as sephirot/sephiroth, singular
                sefirah/sephirah, etc.
                Alternative configurations of the sefirot are interpreted by various schools in the historical evolution
                of Kabbalah, with each articulating differing spiritual aspects. The tradition of enumerating 10 is
                stated in the Sefer Yetzirah, "Ten sefirot of nothingness, ten and not nine, ten and not eleven". As
                altogether 11 sefirot are listed across the various schemes, two (Keter and Da'at) are seen as
                unconscious and conscious manifestations of the same principle, conserving the 10 categories.[1] The
                sefirot are described as channels of divine creative life force or consciousness through which the
                unknowable divine essence is revealed to mankind.
                <br><br>
                The first sefirah, Keter, describes the divine superconscious Will that is beyond conscious intellect.
                The next three sefirot (Chokhmah, Binah and Da'at) describe three levels of conscious divine intellect.
                In particular, Da'at represents Keter in its knowable form, the concept of knowledge. Will and knowledge
                are corresponding somewhat dependent opposites. The seven subsequent sefirot (Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet,
                Netzach, Hod, Yesod and Malkuth) describe the primary and secondary conscious divine emotions. The
                sefirot of the left side and the sefira of Malkuth are feminine, as the female principle in Kabbalah
                describes a vessel that receives the outward male light, then inwardly nurtures and gives birth to the
                sefirot below them. Kabbalah sees the human soul as mirroring the divine (after Genesis 1:27, "God
                created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him, male and female He created them"), and
                more widely, all creations as reflections of their life source in the sefirot. Therefore, the sefirot
                also describe the spiritual life of man, break down man's psychological processes, and constitute the
                conceptual paradigm in Kabbalah for understanding everything. This relationship between the soul of man
                and the divine gives Kabbalah one of its two central metaphors in describing divinity, alongside the
                other Ohr (light) metaphor. However, Kabbalah repeatedly stresses the need to avoid all corporeal
                interpretation. Through this, the sefirot are related to the structure of the body and are reformed into
                partzufim (personas). Underlying the structural purpose of each sefirah is a hidden motivational force
                which is understood best by comparison with a corresponding psychological state in human spiritual
                experience.[1]
                <br><br>
                In Hasidic philosophy, which has sought to internalise the experience of Jewish mysticism into daily
                inspiration (devekut), this inner life of the sefirot is explored, and the role they play in man's
                service of God in this world.
